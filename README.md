# react-menu

A reusable menu component built with React.

## Introduction

A menu is a collections of items that people can click or tap on. It can be hidden to reduce clutter in the interface.

When an item is clicked it performs a certain action. Usually it can show/hide another menu, and/or redirect users to a part of the website.

When a menu is shown, it could be either floating on top of other components in the page (where the menu lives in a different layer on top of other components), or it could push other components away (where the menu lives in the same layer as other components).

The menu bar is a menu.

The popup menu is a menu.

The dock is a menu.

A tree (as in a file explorer) is a menu.
