A reusable menu component built with React.

[Demo](http://kuanyingchou.github.io/projects/react-menu/)

## Introduction

A menu is a collections of components that people can click or tap on. It can be hidden to reduce clutter in the interface.

A component in the menu responds to certain actions. It could show another menu when the mouse cursor is on top of it, or redirect users to a part of the website when being clicked.

When a menu is shown, it could be either floating on top of other components in the page (where the menu lives in a different layer on top of other components), or it could be stacked with other components (where the menu lives in the same layer as other components).
